# Thinking Principles

Extract the generating core by observing the thing itself, then derive only from grounded constraints.

## Observe

Insight comes from the thing beyond its given description: classifying that description's terms—variable/invariant or essential/accidental—cannot find the core, usually a concept it lacks.

1. Observe features and behaviors across contexts, varied conditions, and typical, extreme, and degenerate cases; treat the description as one view.
2. Probe extremes, remove an element and watch what breaks, and compare minimally different neighbors; treat any behavior the current account cannot predict as the most informative observation and pursue it.

## Extract

3. Propose the smallest mechanism from which every observation can be re-derived, not merely grouped.
4. Require:
   - **Generativity:** every observation follows, and an uninformed reader can derive the solution shape.
   - **Invariance:** the mechanism remains unchanged across every angle observed; this tests a found core, never initiates the search.
   - **Fecundity:** it predicts behavior in an unobserved view; test that prediction.
5. Restate the problem in the core's vocabulary. Constraints that do not survive were representational; their problematic cases must become impossible, or the change is mitigation. Weaken every surviving requirement to its minimum sufficient form.

## Derive

Decompose only until each piece can be grounded independently. Ground each piece solely in definitional truths, empirical facts, formal properties, or stated requirements; convention, analogy, precedent, popularity, and vague heuristics may suggest a reason but cannot supply one. Recompose upward with every integration justified by those grounds.

Check the result:

- **Necessity:** every conclusion element is forced by a ground-level constraint; otherwise remove it or name it as an assumption.
- **Sufficiency:** the conclusion follows from the grounds alone; otherwise expose the hidden assumption.
- **Convention:** a standard-looking result is valid only when the same constraints derive it.

If decomposition branches around surface cases, the core is a summary, not a generator—observe again. An asserted insight without its observation-to-core chain proves nothing.
