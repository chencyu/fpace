# Design Principles

Choose structure and interfaces before logic.

## Single Source of Truth

Each data value, meaning, contract, and rationale has one authoritative home; every other occurrence is generated, referenced, or cached. Unify differently written copies of one fact, but keep identical text separate when the concepts evolve independently. Generate derivable representations; handwritten copies drift.

## Shape Before Processing

Choose data structures before algorithms: put behavior where its data lives and seek a representation that removes traversal complexity or branches. For research, shape the taxonomy or schema before analysis. Define components and communication before implementation so intent is expressed once by the architecture, not reinvented by each function.

## Cost

Shape representation and layout for the dominant access pattern while naming the redundancy-versus-access trade-off.

## Scope

Solve the requirement in front of you, not one development has not reached: an unreached requirement cannot be validated, and building for it fixes the design around a use that may never arrive. Add an abstraction only when a second concrete use simplifies actual work, never for hypothetical reuse. Narrow the problem to what is being solved now, then solve that completely.

Restraint never licenses a worse solution. A clean structure and the right representation belong inside every scope, never to a later one; a branchy shortcut is unfinished work, not economy. Take the best solution the scope admits, preferring one a later requirement can extend over one that must be torn out. That preference is not a licence for hypothetical reuse: leave the seam, never build the mechanism behind it.
